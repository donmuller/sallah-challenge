        <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
        <p>posted by BGB, November 15, 2016<br><br> This week I am <em>extremely</em>exicted about a new cooking technique called <em>sous vide.</em>In<em>sous vide</em>cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temprature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book,<em>Cooking for Geeks,</em> Jeff Potter describe it as "ultra-low-temperature poaching."<br><br> Next month,we will be serving <b><em>Sous Vide </em>Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.</b>To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.<br><br>Location;<br>Baker's coner, Seekonk, MA<br><br>Hours:<br> Tuesday to Saturday, 11am to 11pm<br><br>All content copyright&copy; 2017, Black Goose Bistro and Jennifer Robbins </p>
